# EducatorAssistantChat

## 1. Overview
### Summary:
#### Marvel Assistant Chat is a conversational AI interface designed to assist educators and students in performing various tasks efficiently. While V1 already includes basic chat functionality, suggested prompts, and chat history, the next phase (V2) will focus on adding action-based functionalities (e.g., translate, summarize, rewrite, etc.), improving the quality of suggested prompts, and enhancing AI responses to make them more dynamic and personalized.

#### Context:
 Interactive actions and personalized suggestions are essential for making the chat a true virtual assistant. By empowering users with actionable features and intelligent prompts, Marvel Assistant Chat will streamline tasks, improve engagement, and offer practical teaching support.

## 2. Problem Statement
The Issue:

### Limited Functionality: The current implementation lacks actionable tools to execute tasks like translating, summarizing, or rewriting content.
Static Suggested Prompts: Prompts are generic and not tailored to the user’s context or needs.
Basic AI Responses: The current AI responses are helpful but can be improved for better alignment with educational goals.
Impact:
 Without actionable tools and personalized suggestions, the assistant's usefulness is limited, affecting user engagement and task efficiency.

## 3. Target Audience
### Educators: Teachers seeking quick assistance in designing lessons, generating questions, and managing administrative tasks.
Students: Learners looking for content summaries, translations, or help with assignments.
Administrators: Users requiring AI-driven assistance for classroom management and planning.
## 4. Current Features (V1)
### Main Chat Interface: Users can interact with the assistant via text.
Suggested Prompts: Basic example prompts like “Design an engaging activity.”
Chat History: Allows users to revisit past interactions.
## 5. Planned Features (V2)
##### 1. Actions
Introduce actionable functionalities directly accessible through the chat interface:

##### Translate: Convert text or responses into multiple languages.
Summarize: Condense responses into a sentence, paragraph, or bullet points.
Rewrite: Modify responses for clarity, tone, or alternative phrasing.
Question Generation: Create multiple-choice or free-response questions from content.
Custom Prompts: Allow users to define, save, and reuse custom prompts.
2. Suggested Prompts Improvements
Add context-aware and role-specific prompts (e.g., for educators, students, or administrators).
Include dynamic suggestions based on prior user activity or the conversation flow.
3. Enhanced AI Responses
Improve the alignment of responses with educational goals (e.g., generating lesson-specific recommendations).
Enable tailored responses based on user role or previously gathered preferences.
6. Jobs to Be Done
Action-Based Tasks:

"When I interact with the assistant, I want to translate content, so I can communicate with diverse audiences."
"When I input content, I want to generate questions, so I can quickly create quizzes or assignments."
"When I receive a response, I want to rewrite it in a professional tone, so it’s ready to share with students or colleagues."
Prompt Personalization:

"When I use the assistant, I want personalized prompts, so I can quickly access relevant suggestions for my context."
Improved Responses:

"When I ask a question, I want responses tailored to my role, so they are actionable and contextually relevant."
